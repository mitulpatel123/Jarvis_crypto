Real-time tickers & prices

Options with Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)

Funding rates (historical & real-time)

Open interest & mark prices

Order book depth

Account & position data

Trade execution (<100ms latency)

Small 5-10% Gap (Easily Filled):

i want to create jarvis for crypto trading in that we use delta exchange api and groq cloud API , GROQ browser automation , agents, and so on.



I already described this everything, now on the top of that, our Jarvis is complete AI agentic , and autonomous working. All the things will be done by the AI.



So right now we are doing our project in Python, and I want my Jarvis is not just a rule based bot, I want my Jarvis make like every decisions, every data reading by the groq powerful model. So beyond the capability of just a rule based training instead of that, we are actually giving the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to trade in crypto market, analyze the data, news and everything. We also introduce in our Jarvis reinforcement learning based on the data provide of the past.



so our project is not just simple but it is more powerful than any other bot and rule based. trading because we are giving our trading data , news and everything that we discussion over here or mansion over here to the ai brain to take the dynamic decision so it can be accurate and fast and profitable. Because sometimes rule base trading or bot is not capable and also so much waiting for the rules because if rules are met then rules bot start for trading , but this, our Jarvis based on the artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities it finding the trade in the market, just like taking the profit from the ocean. So like every time each and every second continuously scan complete market, plus after also have one more thing to introduce in our Jarvis that after take a treat in the market of crypto make sure each and every second jarvis need to focus on the trade and make sure the trade is closed in the profit for that whatever strategy it need to take. I don't mind because everything on AI.



Over here, I mentioned 30  agents but if you find that we need more agents for something special things that I forgot you can do that also, also make sure to scan the details of Delta exchange India, API what they provide the data for the crypto that we need all the things

You can access the DEX Screener API directly for free without needing to generate an API key for standard usage. The API is public, meaning you can start making requests immediately using their base URL.

1. Base URL

All requests should be made to:

https://api.dexscreener.com

2. How to Use It (No Key Required)

You can call the endpoints directly using your browser, code (Python, JavaScript, etc.), or tools like cURL.

Common Endpoints:

Search for Pairs:

Find pairs by query (e.g., searching for "SOL/USDC").1

GET https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/search?q=SOL/USDC

Get Pairs by Token Address:

Get all trading pairs for a specific token (replace the address with the token's contract address).2

GET https://api.dexscreener.com/token-pairs/v1/{chainId}/{tokenAddress}

Example (Solana): https://api.dexscreener.com/token-pairs/v1/solana/JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN

Get Specific Pair Info:

If you know the specific pair address.

GET https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/pairs/{chainId}/{pairAddresses}

3. Important Limits

Since it is a free public API, there are strict rate limits enforced by IP address:3

60 requests per minute:4 For endpoints like Token Profiles, Boosts, and Orders.5

300 requests per minute: For Pair/Dex related endpoints (Search, Get Pairs).6

also i need one visual page so i can see what jarvis is doing and all 30 agents work or not ? 

Our main focus on get the data from api of delta exchange india + groq browser automation + rest 3 free account apis for more data. I also mention that.

one more thing we need to change that this one.

Can we create charts using Python instead of TradingView? Is it worth it for pattern recognition?"
Answer: ✅ YES - 100% WORTH IT (and vastly superior)

TradingView Screenshot Approach (Current):
├─ Success rate: 36-40% ❌ (blocked by antibot)
├─ Accuracy: 60-65% ❌ (generic vision model)
├─ Speed: 2-5 seconds ❌
├─ Reliability: Antibot protection + rate limits ❌
└─ VERDICT: NOT RECOMMENDED ❌❌❌

Python Charts + Algorithmic Approach (Recommended):
├─ Success rate: 95%+ ✅
├─ Accuracy: 80-95% ✅
├─ Speed: <100ms ✅
├─ Reliability: Zero external dependencies ✅
└─ VERDICT: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ✅✅✅

| Metric         | TradingView | Python | Improvement           |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Success Rate   | 36%         | 95%    | 2.6x better✅          |
| Accuracy       | 65%         | 85-90% | 1.4x better✅          |
| Speed          | 2-5 sec     | <100ms | 40x faster✅           |
| Antibot Issues | Yes ❌       | No ✅   | 100% reliable✅        |
| Rate Limits    | Yes ❌       | No ✅   | Unlimited✅            |
| Backtestable   | No ❌        | Yes ✅  | Enables optimization✅ |
| Cost           | Free        | Free   | Same✅                 |


WHY PYTHON CHARTS WORK BETTER
Problems with TradingView Screenshots:

1. Antibot Protection
   ├─ CloudFlare blocks automated access
   ├─ Requires solving CAPTCHAs
   └─ Success rate: ~30%

2. Rate Limiting
   ├─ 10-20 requests then blocked
   ├─ IP blacklisted for hours
   └─ Makes real-time monitoring impossible

3. Screenshot Quality
   ├─ Headless browser doesn't render all content
   ├─ Charts load asynchronously
   ├─ JavaScript-heavy pages fail
   └─ Image quality degrades

4. Groq Vision Limitations
   ├─ 60-65% accuracy on financial charts
   ├─ Designed for general images, not trading
   ├─ Makes mistakes on similar patterns
   └─ Not optimized for candlestick analysis

5. Latency
   ├─ Wait for page load: 1-2 seconds
   ├─ Take screenshot: 0.5-1 second
   ├─ Upload to Groq: 0.5 second
   ├─ Groq analysis: 1-2 seconds
   └─ Total: 3-6 seconds per pattern check (TOO SLOW)

Why Python Charts Are Better:

1. Direct Data Access
   ├─ Delta Exchange API provides raw OHLC
   ├─ 99.9% reliable connection
   ├─ No antibot issues
   └─ No rate limits

2. Algorithmic Detection (Deterministic)
   ├─ Same input = same output (always)
   ├─ 80-95% accuracy on well-defined patterns
   ├─ Can understand why pattern detected
   └─ Fully optimizable with historical data

3. Speed
   ├─ Get data: 100ms
   ├─ Detect pattern: <50ms
   ├─ Generate chart: <100ms
   └─ Total: <250ms per analysis (INSTANT)

4. Scalability
   ├─ Can analyze 1,000 patterns/second
   ├─ No API rate limits
   ├─ Run 24/7 without blocking
   └─ Perfect for high-frequency monitoring

5. Backtestable
   ├─ Apply same algorithm to historical data
   ├─ Measure actual win rate
   ├─ Optimize parameters
   └─ Refine before live trading

┌─ Real-time OHLC from Delta Exchange India API
│
├─ STEP 1: ALGORITHMIC PATTERN DETECTION ✅ PRIMARY
│  ├─ Head & Shoulders
│  ├─ Double Bottom/Top
│  ├─ Support/Resistance Breakout
│  ├─ Triangle Breakout
│  ├─ Flag Pattern
│  └─ Confidence: 80-95%
│
├─ STEP 2: Create Python Chart (Plotly)
│  ├─ Candlestick chart
│  ├─ Add indicators (MA, RSI, MACD)
│  ├─ Annotate detected patterns
│  ├─ Interactive (zoom, hover)
│  └─ No dependencies on TradingView
│
├─ STEP 3: GROQ VISION (Optional, SECONDARY only)
│  ├─ IF algorithmic confidence < 70%
│  ├─ OR pattern type not recognized
│  ├─ Ask Groq: "Validate this pattern?"
│  └─ Use as CONFIRMATION, not primary signal
│
└─ Final Signal: Algorithmic + Vision consensus
   ├─ Both agree: 0.90+ confidence
   ├─ Algorithmic only: 0.80+ confidence
   └─ Vision only: Too risky (skip)
Agent 6: Pattern Recognition (IMPROVED)
├─ Data Source: Delta Exchange API → Python Algorithmic Detection
├─ Update Frequency: 1 minute (per candle)
├─ Confidence: 80-95% ✅ (+40%)
├─ Benefits: Fast, reliable, backtestable, zero external deps
├─ Optional: Groq Vision for validation only
└─ Success Rate: 95% ✅ (+164%)



Right now, I have nine API of groq, you can use this later on if we need more we can add more API of groq ,+ others. 

GROQ_API_KEY_1="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_1"
GROQ_API_KEY_2="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_2"
GROQ_API_KEY_3="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_3"
GROQ_API_KEY_4="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_4"
GROQ_API_KEY_5="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_5"
GROQ_API_KEY_6="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_6"
GROQ_API_KEY_7="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_7"
GROQ_API_KEY_8="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_8"
GROQ_API_KEY_9="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_9"


also provide paper trading + live trading. 

in the visual or ui what you make for jarvis  so i can see every fuction ,all the agents , brain everything is working or not ? also if any error that also i can see on the ui or visual. 

+

Make sure about these things that I don't want any hardcode every decision takes by the artificial intelligence plus machine learning so it is more powerful than human plus rule based bot.

Self improved from back testing + live trading.
